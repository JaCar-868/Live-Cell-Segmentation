# Live-Cell Segmentation Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to segment and analyze live-cell imaging data. The model uses deep learning techniques to accurately identify and segment cells from microscopy images. This enables precise measurement of cellular behaviors and properties, which is crucial for various biological and biopharmaceutical research applications. The project leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow/Keras to process and analyze high-quality annotated datasets.
